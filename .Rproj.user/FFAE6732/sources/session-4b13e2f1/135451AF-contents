## Welcome to the GeoEpi Group's GitHub

###  [Research Notebook](https://geoepi.github.io/Notebook/):
The GeoEpi Notebook is a resource designed for and by group members and collaborators engaged in geographical epidemiology and data science. Its purpose is to share and refine the best practices, standards, and guidelines essential for ensuring reproducible science across the domains of scientific computing, coding, data management, and modeling. Importantly, this notebook is envisioned as a living documentâ€”continually updated to reflect the latest insights, solutions, and efficiencies. It is not a compendium of rigid requirements but a collection of recommended approaches designed to enhance the quality and integrity of our work.

###  [Research Group Website](https://geoepi.github.io/):
The GeoEpi Group investigates animal disease transmission and outbreak dynamics. Leveraging statistical and mathematical modeling, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence, our work aims to bridge the molecular and landscape scales to reveal insights into the ecology and spatiotemporal dynamics of foreign, transboundary, emerging, and zoonotic animal diseases.
