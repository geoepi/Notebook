## The GeoEpi Research Group  {.unnumbered}   
  
The GeoEpi Group investigates animal disease transmission and outbreak dynamics. Leveraging statistical and mathematical modeling, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence, our work aims to bridge the molecular and landscape scales to reveal insights into the ecology and spatiotemporal dynamics of foreign, transboundary, emerging, and zoonotic animal diseases.   

The *GeoEpi Notebook* is a resource designed for and by lab members and collaborators engaged in geographical epidemiology and data science. The notebook establishes and promotes best practices, standards, and guidelines critical for reproducible science in scientific computing, coding, data management, and modeling.
